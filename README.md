#Dotfiles - andyjamesdavies

Based on Addy Osmani's dotfiles project: https://github.com/addyosmani/dotfiles I have chosen and added some of my own aliases.

##Installation

Place these files in your home directory. Reload your shell and away you go.

##Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults (make sure this file is executable):

    ./.osx
